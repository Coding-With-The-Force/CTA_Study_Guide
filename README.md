This has my notes for studying for the Salesforce CTA Exam. I will share as much about my CTA Journey as I am legally allowed to do in this wiki.

Answer each requirement directly with no more than 3-4 sentences. Do not ramble. Answer questions in the same way.

Opt for custom over managed packages unless the users would use the majority of the managed packages and you know how to defend it.

All integrations should have Enterprise Service Bus used like Mulesoft handle things. No point to point integrations.
